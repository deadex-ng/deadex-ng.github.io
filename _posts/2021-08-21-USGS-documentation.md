# USGS DOcumentation

I have built an easy to use, reliable and
well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch,
visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. In particular, the code
will interface with [USGS 3DEP](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep) and fetch data using their API.

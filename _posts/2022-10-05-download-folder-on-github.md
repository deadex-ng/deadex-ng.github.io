# Download a Single Folder on Github
## Overview
Today, I wanted to work an Geospatial data. I found a really good repository and I wanted to quickly try out the code on my machine.
Cloning the entire repo was taking too long and in fact I wasn't interested the other details, I just wanted the data files. I struggled to 
clone the entire repo all day until I came across this tool on stackoverflow, [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit).

DownGit, allows you to download a specific folder in a repository by passing in the URL path of the folder.

## Using DownGit
Copy the URL of the folder you want to download and paste it in DownGit search bar.
![Downloading Repository Folder](\_images\downgit.PNG "Downloading Repository Folder").
![Some text]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/_images/downgit.PNG)
